          <h2>Vincent van Gogh</h2>
          <p>
            Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890) was a Dutch
            Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and
            influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a
            decade he created approximately 2100 artworks, including around 860
            oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They
            include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and
            are characterised by bold, symbolic colours, and dramatic, impulsive
            and highly expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations
            of modern art. Only one of his paintings was known by name to have
            been sold during his lifetime. Van Gogh became famous after his
            suicide at age 37, which followed years of poverty and mental
            illness.
