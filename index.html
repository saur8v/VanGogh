          <h2>Part One</h2>
          <p>
            Between the years of 1881 to 1890, Vincent van Gogh finished 900
            paintings. This alone is a remarkable achievement, but when viewed
            in succession, one sees the gradual development of an artistic
            genius.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you explore the paintings, notice the shift in color and texture
            with each passing year. Vincent’s initial style uses very dark and
            subdued colors. Once he moves to Paris in 1887, there is a startling
            shift, and his colors come alive. Here we begin to see the
            beginnings of Vincent’s celebrated style.

          <h2>Part Two</h2>
          <p>
            Vincent’s final three years present us with a paradox, which cannot
            be reconciled. As his mental health is declining, paradoxically, his
            paintings are showing the evidence of a creative genius.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vincent’s most debilitating psychotic attack happens on the evening
            of December 23rd, 1888. This results in the most infamous event in
            art history: Vincent van Gogh cutting off his ear. The details and
            context surrounding this catalyst event are fully explored in
            Episode 23: Vincent van Gogh • Madness, Genius, & Tragedy (Part
            Two.)

          <h2>The Asylum</h2>
          <p>
            On May 8th, 1889, Vincent van Gogh checks in to a mental asylum.
            What begins as a three month stay extends into a year. A period of
            time during which Vincent paints 141 masterpieces in between bouts
            of debilitating psychotic attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this episode, we dive into Vincent and Theo’s letters to finally
            uncover all of the details about Vincent’s yearlong stay in the
            asylum.

          <h2>At Eternity's Gate</h2>
          <p>Vincent van Gogh is shot on July 27th, 1890.</p>
          <p>
            Art historians and Vincent enthusiasts have wrestled with the
            details of that tragic day for over a century. Despite decades of
            conjecture, the question remains: suicide or homicide?
          </p>
          <p>
            And in the end, we celebrate the woman who made Vincent van Gogh the
            household name that he is today: Johanna van Gogh-Bonger.
